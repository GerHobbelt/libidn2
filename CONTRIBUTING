wants to build from version controlled sources.  You need to have
several tools installed, including:

- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- Libtool <http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/>
- help2man <http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/>
- Gengetopt <http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/>
- Tar <http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/>

- Valgrind <http://valgrind.org/> (optional)
- libunistring <https://www.gnu.org/software/libunistring/>

The required software is typically distributed with your operating
system, and the instructions for installing them differ.  Here are
some hints for gNewSense/Debian/Ubuntu:

apt-get install git autoconf automake libtool
apt-get install help2man gtk-doc-tools valgrind gengetopt

Download the version controlled sources:

$ git clone https://gitlab.com/jas/libidn2.git
$ cd libidn2

Prepare building with

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure

Then build the project normally:

$ make
$ make check

Happy hacking!
