Libidn2 is a free software implementation of IDNA2008 and TR46.

RFC 5890: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5890
RFC 5891: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891
RFC 5892: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5892
RFC 5893: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5893
TR46: http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/

Libidn2 is believed to be a complete IDNA2008 and TR46 implementation,
but has yet to be as extensively used as the IDNA2003 Libidn library.

Software releases of libidn2 can be downloaded from
https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/libidn/ and ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/libidn/

Development of libidn2 is organized through GitLab --
https://gitlab.com/jas/libidn2 -- and there is a issue tracker for
reporting bugs, see: https://gitlab.com/jas/libidn2/issues

The installed C library libidn2 is dual-licensed under LGPLv3+|GPLv2+,
while the rest of the package is GPLv3+.  See the file COPYING for

Libidn2 uses GNU libunistring for Unicode processing and GNU libiconv
for character set conversion.  See the following links for more
information on these packages:
